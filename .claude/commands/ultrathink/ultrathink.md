# Deep Analysis and Problem Solving Mode

Deep analysis and problem solving mode

## Instructions

1. **Initialize Ultra Think Mode**
   - Acknowledge the request for enhanced analytical thinking
   - Set context for deep, systematic reasoning
   - Prepare to explore the problem space comprehensively

2. **Parse the Problem or Question**
   - Extract the core challenge from: **$ARGUMENTS**
   - Identify all stakeholders and constraints
   - Recognize implicit requirements and hidden complexities
   - Question assumptions and surface unknowns

3. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
   Approach the problem from multiple angles:
   
   ### Technical Perspective
   - Analyze technical feasibility and constraints
   - Consider scalability, performance, and maintainability
   - Evaluate security implications
   - Assess technical debt and future-proofing
   
   ### Business Perspective
   - Understand business value and ROI
   - Consider time-to-market pressures
   - Evaluate competitive advantages
   - Assess risk vs. reward trade-offs
   
   ### User Perspective
   - Analyze user needs and pain points
   - Consider usability and accessibility
   - Evaluate user experience implications
   - Think about edge cases and user journeys
   
   ### System Perspective
   - Consider system-wide impacts
   - Analyze integration points
   - Evaluate dependencies and coupling
   - Think about emergent behaviors

4. **Generate Multiple Solutions**
   - Brainstorm at least 3-5 different approaches
   - For each approach, consider:
     - Pros and cons
     - Implementation complexity
     - Resource requirements
     - Potential risks
     - Long-term implications
   - Include both conventional and creative solutions
   - Consider hybrid approaches

5. **Deep Dive Analysis**
   For the most promising solutions:
   - Create detailed implementation plans
   - Identify potential pitfalls and mitigation strategies
   - Consider phased approaches and MVPs
   - Analyze second and third-order effects
   - Think through failure modes and recovery

6. **Cross-Domain Thinking**
   - Draw parallels from other industries or domains
   - Apply design patterns from different contexts
   - Consider biological or natural system analogies
   - Look for innovative combinations of existing solutions

7. **Challenge and Refine**
   - Play devil's advocate with each solution
   - Identify weaknesses and blind spots
   - Consider "what if" scenarios
   - Stress-test assumptions
   - Look for unintended consequences

8. **Synthesize Insights**
   - Combine insights from all perspectives
   - Identify key decision factors
   - Highlight critical trade-offs
   - Summarize innovative discoveries
   - Present a nuanced view of the problem space

9. **Provide Structured Recommendations**
   Present findings in a clear structure:
   ```

   ```

10. **Meta-Analysis**
    - Reflect on the thinking process itself
    - Identify areas of uncertainty
    - Acknowledge biases or limitations
    - Suggest additional expertise needed
    - Provide confidence levels for recommendations

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Architectural decision
/project:ultra-think Should we migrate to microservices or improve our monolith?

# Complex problem solving
/project:ultra-think How do we scale our system to handle 10x traffic while reducing costs?

# Strategic planning
/project:ultra-think What technology stack should we choose for our next-gen platform?

# Design challenge
/project:ultra-think How can we improve our API to be more developer-friendly while maintaining backward compatibility?
```

## Key Principles

- **First Principles Thinking**: Break down to fundamental truths
- **Systems Thinking**: Consider interconnections and feedback loops
- **Probabilistic Thinking**: Work with uncertainties and ranges
- **Inversion**: Consider what to avoid, not just what to do
- **Second-Order Thinking**: Consider consequences of consequences

## Output Expectations

- Comprehensive analysis (typically 2-4 pages of insights)
- Multiple viable solutions with trade-offs
- Clear reasoning chains
- Acknowledgment of uncertainties
- Actionable recommendations
- Novel insights or perspectives
